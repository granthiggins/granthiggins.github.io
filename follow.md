## Start here
The best way to keep in touch, follow my work and discover interesting ideas is to [subscribe to my newsletter](/newsletter).

## Choose your social network
### Option 1: Twitter
Follow [@blairrorani](http://twitter.com/blairrorani).

**Note:** I used to tweet from @everlearningnow. From now on you should follow @blairrorani instead :)

### Option 2: LinkedIn
Connect with or follow me on LinkedIn. Here's how to decide.

Invite me to connect if:

* we went to school or worked together
* met in real life

Otherwise, please **follow me** instead. Here's how.

1. View my profile.
2. Hover over the drop down next to my photo.
3. Select [View recent activity](http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/activities/blair-rorani+0_04Ka02YJqdHY9cCZ6s8UXY?trk=prof-0-sb-rcnt-act-link)

### Options 3, 4 and 5
* I post most of my visual notes on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/blairrorani).
* I use [Tumblr](http://blairrorani.tumblr.com) as my digital scrapbook.
* I also do some [Instagramming](https://instagram.com/blairrorani/), mainly of family stuff (which gets posted to my Tumblr anyway).
