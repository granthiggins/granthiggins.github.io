It's good to draw. It's better to share what you drew. And sometimes it's best to share how you drew it. It's all part of <a href="http://showyrwork.com" target="_blank">showing your work</a>.

While I've been doing the <a href="twitter-drawathon" target="_blank">draw-a-thon</a> I've also been recording videos of <a href="../drawathon-day-1">how I draw my pictures</a>.

Here's how I do it (no this isn't the only way).

* Step 1: Get a **Mac**.
* Step 2: Connect your iPad to your Mac using a usb connector.
* Step 3: Open **QuickTime Player**.
* Step 4: Click **File > New Movie Recording**.
* Step 5: From the drop down list next to the record button click the name of your iPad.
* Step 6: Click **Record**. You'll see the recording begin.
* Step 7: When you've finished recording your iPad, click **Stop**.
* Step 8: Click **File > Save** to save your recording.

From here you can edit your recording using the software of your choice (e.g. iMovie, Camtasia, Windows Movie Maker?)
