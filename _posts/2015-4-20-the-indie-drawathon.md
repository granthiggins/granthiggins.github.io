As you may have know, I ran a [Twitter draw-a-thon](http://blair.rorani.com/twitter-drawathon) at the end of March.

It ran for 15 days and there was a special [surprise](http://blair.rorani.com/drawathon-day-16) at the end for those who followed along.

However, it turns out some tweeps enjoyed it so much that they couldn't stop drawing. Led by [@elearningjeff](http://twitter.com/elearningjeff) and [@ashi_tandon](http://twitter.com/ashi_tandon) people have been continuing to set daily drawing challenges for themselves and sharing the results on Twitter.

This is awesome for two reasons:

* Everybody can benefit from drawing more.
* Something that started as a fun idea has caught on and people are running with it.

I'm calling it the **indie draw-a-thon** because a small community of dedicated drawers have taken over where I left off and are driving the drawing themselves. Nice work.

Want to brush up on your drawing skills? Join the indie draw-a-thon. Just follow the [#everybodydrawnow](http://twitter.com/hashtag/everybodydrawnow) hashtag and you'll see a different picture to draw each day.
