As promised, the weekly creative instructional design lessons are transforming into something even better. Here's an appetiser.

Imagine you're learning how to cook. How would you do it?

## Step 1
Learning starts with a goal you want to achieve (become a better at cooking breads and deserts).

## Step 2
To achieve that goal you’ll need a certain skill set (your basic cake, layer cakes, muffins, pastries, etc).

## Step 3
The way to perform these skills correctly is explained in the manual (recipe book). This is what instructional designers / L and D people spend most of their time on. Except for some reason they turn the manual into an online module or workshop. The manual is another way of describing the steps, tips and traps, examples, and quick reference guides.

One of many good examples is [Basecamp Help](http://basecamp.com/help). See how all the info you need is right there? The manual is so good you almost don't need too much *training*.

## Step 4
Before you will be able to bake properly you’ll need to practise following the manual (do challenges like bake a chocolate cake, make icing, add cream, bake scones, bake bread, etc). Practise makes perfect after all. You’ll also benefit from sharing your outputs with an expert and getting feedback so you can improve your outputs next time. An expert would be an actual baker who can give you tips on improving the quality of your chocolate cake.

## What about elearning and workshops?
This this model can be work as a simulation (online or face-to-face) or on the job (if it’s okay to just practise baking a few cakes before you start serving them to the customers). On the job is more like a master / apprentice model that lots of industries used to use way back. This is always the best way to learn. Social learning with or without the internet.

## So what?
In the coming weeks I'll break down all of this in more detail and explain how you can apply it to the creation of instructional experiences. Plus I'll show you how to incorporate creative instructional design principles and methods.
