Tom Kuhlmann featured my work and my new book [Everybody Draw Now](http://everybodydrawnow.com) on [his blog ](http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/create-hand-drawn-graphics/).

His post is a nice round up of how to get better at drawing for work purposes and is the third in a series of posts about [visual thinking and communication](http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/practice-visual-thinking-skills-apply-e-learning).

If you don't already know, Tom is probably the most famous elearning blogger there is. Here runs the community over at Articulate. You should [subscribe to get his updates](http://www.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/about-tom/) and his free e-book.
